# IoT Enabled Green House Environment Automation
- This is the research project for the partial fulfillment for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.
- Our system employs a network of sensors to gather data on essential greenhouse variables,
including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. We utilize the
ESP32 Wroom 32U microcontroller to transmit and visualize real-time data on the Arduino
Cloud platform. Once the data is stored, it undergoes comparison with optimal
values, triggering the operation of actuators accordingly. Historical data can be downloaded
from the Arduino Cloud in CSV format.

- As data transmission over the internet is susceptible to cyber attacks, our system incorporates
an attack detection layer. This layer identifies potential attacks on the network
and implements necessary measures to prevent breaches of confidential data.

- In our design, we have employed the ESP32 Wroom microcontroller for acquiring
sensor data, and the Arduino Cloud is utilized for storing the collected data. The DHT11
sensor is utilized for measuring humidity and temperature. For assessing soil water content,
a soil moisture sensor is utilized. An LDR module is employed for measuring light
intensity. Additionally, an LCD display is utilized for on-site monitoring of environmental
parameters
